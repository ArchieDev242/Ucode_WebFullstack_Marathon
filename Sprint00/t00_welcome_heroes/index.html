    <p>
        A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, 
        <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, 
        and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.
        <br> 
        For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. 
        But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal 
        human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

        Deadpool, aka Wade Wilson, is a former special forces operative who becomes a mercenary. After undergoing an experimental procedure that grants him accelerated healing powers, he adopts the alter-ego of Deadpool. His healing factor allows him to survive mortal wounds and regenerate from injuries, making him nearly invincible. Deadpool is known for his quick wit, dark humor, and tendency to break the fourth wall. He often blurs the lines between hero and anti-hero, using unconventional methods to fight crime, and has become a beloved character in the Marvel Universe.
